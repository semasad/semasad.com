I make public the code of my web for 2 reasons:

1) I want to show how I make it, my skills, and use it as a CV, my presentation card. Its a good way to show me as a good front-end and back-end.

2) I belive in the open source life style. I like to share what I do, because to someone can be useful.

I make it with: HTML (5), CSS (3) and Javascript (jQuery). Is a simple 'static' web.
